line10="[No doubt the mandatory surgery you undertook before becoming a Cadet has aided you in developing this talent… But sadly, despite decades of research, we have not been able to induce SightParsing through surgery and training alone.]"
line11="[We have discovered that SightParsing instead requires a singular, focal point of exertion on behalf of the test subject - a moment of acute stress that finally unveils the talent within the individual]"

screen3=[line9,line10,line11,line12]

line13="[Unfortunately, as you may be aware, our Legal Team has recommended that we suspend all field exams until the unfortunate incidents that took place during the last several tests have been fully investigated.]"

line35="Some background - they called me in a couple of days, put me under sedation and stuffed some kind of subdermal pad under my left ear. Hurt like hell but that’s par the course for this job. "
line36="They asked me to give my account of how exactly I induced my SightParsing ability. All I have to do is talk, and the pad will act as some sort of emotional translator, editing the transcript to match my feelings and emotions more accurately. "
line37="I don’t really know how the tech behind this works, nor do I particularly care."
line38="They said that this thing will be popped into a computer and used as training for future Cadets, which gave me a good chuckle. Do they really think that they can replicate the level of sheer panic needed to induce SightParsing?

line84="There have been a few altercations with some of the instructors, but that’s par the course with Cadets. To be honest, I sometimes feel like Commander Paulson encourages it. "
line85="As Enforcers, it’s not likely that we will survive without being able to confront those who stand against us, whether it be through words or through violence. "
screen23=[line81,line82,line83,line84,line85]

line86="I turn the corner and finally see the door to the Briefing Room ahead of me. It’s a large, metal door, dented and scarred from generations of Cadets, Enforcers and Commanders cutting notches in it on their way in and out of meetings. "

line113="It makes sense, I suppose - no-one stays a Cadet for over a decade, they either flunk out or get promoted - but it doesn’t feel real. "

line116="- This is a great honour for you, Cadet. But be aware that this will be a challenge unlike anything you have faced yet."
line117="On-Lam is not a happy man, and he has not taken kindly to being captured. If I may make a suggestion…"

line122="- The Melt will let you see - and feel - On-Lam’s experiences up until his capture as if you were On-Lam himself. "
line123="Be aware that he knows that our officers can use the Melt - he probably has psychic defenses up against such methods. He may have several cover stories concocted to throw you off course."
line124="Make sure that you explore his mind thoroughly, and try to make decisions that you think the true On-Lam will have made - that way you will find the true path through his mind. "
line125="The things you will see… they may be deeply unpleasant, to say the least. "
line126="Just be aware that they represent events the way On-Lam experienced them, not necessarily the way they happened. "
screen35=[line122,line123,line124,line125,line126]

line127="We know that right before his capture, On-Lam had in his possession three containers, which look like perfectly black cubes."
line128="He no longer had them on him when he was captured. "
line129="Your goal is to enter his mind and figure out where exactly he left them, so that we can retrieve them. "

line144="Paulson walks over and I can see a syringe in his left hand. "
line145="I’m not scared of needles, but my skin crawls as he gently pokes the sedative into my neck and pushes the plunger. I barely feel a thing. "
line146="My vision blurs, and the only thing I can see is the Commander’s glasses, the only constant in a room full of smoke. "

line166="And then I see him - or, at least, what’s visible of him. "
line167="On-Lam is stood in the middle of the room, his arms and feet constrained with shackles that are of a material I can’t seem to place."
line168="His body is suspended in the air by chains that are affixed to every corner of the loop - the effect is that of a floating coffin. "
line169="There is a helmet on his head, made of the same material as the shackles, which covers his eyes. "
line170="His mouth is the only part of his body that is visible. His lips are held together so tight that they look like some sort of wound, and I wonder if he is in pain. "
screen50=[line166,line167,line168,line169,line170]

line171="I catch myself almost immediately. "
line172="You can’t think of this scum as people. "

line183="The readings… they’re off the charts. "
line184="Definitely not just standard memories over there in his head… there’s more there."
line185="A trap for me, no doubt. "

line187="‘Do it!’ I hear him yell as I press down on the execute command on my wrist…"

line189="Some of the other minor drug-pushers I’ve had to Melt during training with had tiny, insignificant minds. "
line190="In the Melt interface the content of their heads were represented by tiny, dirty shacks with almost nothing inside. "
line191="In comparison, On-Lam’s mind in front of me is a colossal palace, full of intricate rooms, stairs and doors, looping in and out of themselves. "
