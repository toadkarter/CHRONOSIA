line10="[No doubt the mandatory surgery you undertook before becoming a Cadet has aided you in developing this talent… But sadly, despite decades of research, we have not been able to induce SightParsing through surgery and training alone.]"

line16="[As you are no doubt aware, her recent death at the hands of the vile Shogunate has sent shockwaves across San Weyhoon - her murder, like the murder of Commander Emily Yu before her, will be avenged. Perhaps it will be you that dispenses justice at the hands of our enemies!]"

screen8=[line35,line36]

line37="My name is Ambrosia Monad. I am an Enforcer. "
line38="Enforcer… I’ve been calling myself that for a few weeks now, but saying it out still feels new to me. I suppose the person reading this will go through the same thing… Well. I hope so, at least. "

line39="Hey you, behind the glass - is any of this coming through? You guys getting the recording OK? "
line40="Good. Alright. "
line41="Ah, they’ve left now. I guess they did tell me they would do that. They said that it’s to give me some privacy, to make sure that I can give as subjective an account of what happened as possible, but who are they kidding. "
line42="We both know that as soon as I am done here, the guys in legal will be crawling all over this text to make sure that I didn’t hurt the feelings of any Chronodrones up on the top floor. "
line43="It’s not like I care, anyway. After what I saw… I know that I’m on my way out. Might as well be as honest as I can, while I still can. Maybe someone, somewhere will be able to read this unedited version, before it’s sanitised and mutilated beyond all recognition. "
screen10=[line39,line40,line41,line42,line43]

line44="Some background - they called me in a couple of days, put me under sedation and stuffed some kind of subdermal pad under my left ear. Hurt like hell but that’s par the course for this job. "
line45="They asked me to give my account of how exactly I induced my SightParsing ability. All I have to do is talk, and the pad will act as some sort of emotional translator, editing the transcript to match my feelings and emotions more accurately. "
line46="I don’t really know how the tech behind this works, nor do I particularly care."
line47="They said that this thing will be popped into a computer and used as training for future Cadets, which gave me a good chuckle. "

screen11=[line44,line45,line46,line47,line48]

line49="No matter."

line72="Something doesn’t feel right. "

line94="All traces of sleep are gone now, as I lock the door to my quarters behind me and make my way to the Briefing Room. "
line95="I am immediately drawn to the worst case scenario. Am I finally getting dropped from the programme? "
line96="My performance has been consistently above average for months, so it doesn’t seem likely that they’ll boot me for lack of progress. "
line97="There have been a few altercations with some of the instructors, but that’s par the course with Cadets. To be honest, I sometimes feel like Commander Paulson encourages it. "
line98="As Enforcers, it’s not likely that we will survive without being able to confront those who stand against us, whether it be through words or through violence. "
screen25=[line94,line95,line96,line97,line98]

line99="I turn the corner and finally see the door to the Briefing Room ahead of me. It’s a large, metal door, dented and scarred from generations of Cadets, Enforcers and Commanders cutting notches in it on their way in and out of meetings. "
line100="They say it’s good luck. "
line101="I never believed it, but as I open the door and walk into the large auditorium inside, the thought of making a little notch crosses my mind."
screen26=[line99,line100,line101]

line102="The smell of tobacco hits me immediately. It’s a large room, but Paulson’s legendary smoking habit has been at work here. I can barely make her out in the center, sitting behind a desk so large it’s almost funny.. "
line103="Paulson is a short woman, so all I can see of her behind that monstrosity of a table is her tiny head. "
line104="Her glasses glisten menacingly in the dark."

line105="- Glory to Admiral Radius. Have a seat, Monad."
line106="I walk over to the chair opposite my commander, trying not to cough from all the smoke. "

line112="- Well, then. I guess I’ll get right down to it."
line113="The Commander picks up a glass of water and sips pensively. For a moment, I can see the water’s reflection in her glasses, and the reflection of the glasses in the water. "
line114="The effect is dizzying. "
line115="I feel unwell."
screen29=[line109,line110,line111,line112,line113,line114,line115]

line117="My heart stops. How?"
screen30=[line116,line117]

line118="The Commander pauses, clearly enjoying this shocking reveal, before continuing."
line119="- And we want you to interrogate him. I’m sure you have a lot of questions, Cadet. Be quick about it - we will need to get started soon."
screen31=[line118,line119]

line120="She takes off her glasses and rubs them with a handkerchief. "
line121="The thick smoke still makes it hard to see her eyes clearly, but I can tell that she’s tired."
screen32=[line120,line121]

line122="- I was sure you would be wondering why you’ve been tasked with interrogating a high-ranking member of one of the most feared gangs in this city. "
line123="The simple answer is - I think you’re ready. "
line124="I know we’ve had our differences over the years, but you are an exemplary Cadet. If this goes well… I’ll be personally recommending you for the position of Enforcer.’"
screen33=[line122,line123,line124]

line125="I knew this day would come, but I am still shocked. "
line126="It makes sense, I suppose - no-one stays a Cadet for over a decade, they either flunk out or get promoted - but it still doesn’t feel real. "
line127="I get the odd sensation of watching my own body from a distance, as if I am detached from what’s going on. "
screen34=[line125,line126,line127]

line128="Paulson’s glasses seem to sparkle, and I think I can see a hint of a smile. Or a smirk. "
line129="- This is a great honour for you, Cadet. But be aware that this will be a challenge unlike anything you have faced yet."
line130="On-Lam is not a happy woman right now, and she has not taken kindly to being captured. If I may make a suggestion…"
line131="You should probably start off with a verbal interrogation. See what she gives willingly. "
line132="After that, you can use the Melt."
screen35=[line128,line129,line130,line131,line132]

line133="I am suddenly grateful that I enrolled in extra Melt training a few years back. "
line134="The mental fortitude required for such a procedure is strenuous enough with a willing subject, let alone a criminal like On-Lam. "
screen36=[line133,line134]

line135="- The Melt will let you see - and feel - On-Lam’s experiences up until her capture as if you were On-Lam herself. "
line136="Be aware that she knows that our officers can use the Melt - she probably has psychic defenses up against such methods. She may have several cover stories concocted to throw you off course."
line137="Make sure that you explore her mind thoroughly, and try to make decisions that you think the true On-Lam will have made - that way you will find the true path through her mind. "
line138="The things you will see… they may be deeply unpleasant, to say the least. "
line139="Just be aware that they represent events the way On-Lam experienced them, not necessarily the way they happened. "
screen37=[line135,line136,line137,line138,line139]

line140="We know that right before her capture, On-Lam had in his possession four containers, which look like perfectly black cubes."
line141="She no longer had them on her when she was captured. "
line142="Your goal is to enter her mind and figure out where exactly she left them, so that we can retrieve them. "
line143="I cannot tell you what those containers contain… but what I can tell you is that their contents are of extreme importance to our client. "
line144="You *must* find out their location."
screen38=[line140,line141,line142,line143,line144]

line145="She leans back in her chair. "
line146="- My final piece of advice to you, Cadet."
line147="I know you and your peers have long awaited the gift of SightParsing - the final requirement you need to fulfil before you have all the skills you need to become an Enforcer. "
line148="This final test that I have set in front of you…"
line149="This is the exact set of stressful circumstances that you need to activate this gift. "
line150="You will be in great danger, and you will feel out of your depth - at times you may feel like you have failed, even - but just remember…"
screen39=[line145,line146,line147,line148,line149,line150]

line151="Failure is not the end - it’s a new beginning."
screen40=[line151]

line152="And then we both go quiet, sitting in the smoky room, waiting for… something. "
line153="- If you’re ready, Cadet?"
line154="I nod."
line155="“I’m ready, Commander.”"
screen41=[line152,line153,line154,line155]

line156="- Good. As I’m sure you’re aware, On-Lam’s location is highly classified, even to you. I will have to sedate you before transporting you over to her."
line157="Paulson walks over and I can see a syringe in her left hand. "
line158="I’m not scared of needles, but my skin crawls as she gently pokes the sedative into my neck and pushes the plunger. I barely feel a thing. "
line159="My vision blurs, and the only thing I can see is the Commander’s glasses, the only constant in a room full of smoke. "
screen42=[line156,line157,line158,line159]

line160="I think I hear her repeat the words, “failure is not the end” again, before my vision goes completely dark…"
line161="And then, just silence. "
screen43=[line160,line161]

line162="…"
line163="…"
line164="…"
line165="…"
line166="…"

line167=" "
line168="I wake to harsh light and a low hum. "
line169="My body is numb, but as I try to move my extremities, I can sense the feeling slowly begin to return. "
line170="I am still in the chair where Commander Paulson sedated me, but the room is different."
line171="I recognise it from training. "
screen45=[line167,line168,line169,line170,line171]

line172="This is the interrogation chamber. I have questioned virtual recreations of all manner of human scum - war criminals and assassins, drug pushers and holo-pirates - over the course of my training…"
line173="But I have never practiced the Melt on a living human being. "
line174="I stand up out of the chair and feel a little dizzy. I vaguely wonder how long I have been unconscious. "
screen46=[line172,line173,line174]

line175="Ahead of me is a door behind which lies my target… and my victim. "
line176="I walk across the metal doorway and present my retina for scanning. "
line177="The sensor beeps lazily and the door swings open. "
line178="I walk in, trying to swallow, but my throat is far too dry for that."
screen47=[line175,line176,line177,line178]

line179="And then I see her - or, at least, what’s visible of her. "
line180="On-Lam is stood in the middle of the room, her arms and feet constrained with shackles that are of a material I can’t seem to place."
line181="Her body is suspended in the air by chains that are affixed to every corner of the loop - the effect is that of a floating coffin. "
line182="There is a helmet on her head, made of the same material as the shackles, which covers her eyes. "
line183="Her mouth is the only part of her body that is visible. Her lips are held together so tight that they look like some sort of wound, and I wonder if she is in pain."
line184="Something about her presence feels… familiar. "
screen48=[line179,line180,line181,line182,line183,line184]

line185="I catch myself almost immediately. "
line186="You can’t think of this scum as people. "
line187="As Commander Paulson said… it’s better to start with a verbal interrogation before conducting a Melt. "
line188="I take a deep breath… and begin. "
screen49=[line185,line186,line187,line188]

line189="‘You tell me, Chrono-scum.’"
line190="He smiles, but there’s no cruelty in it. "
line191="She’s almost sad. "
line192="‘I know you’re just itching to use that thing on your wrist."
line193="Well, if you’re going to poke around inside my head, I’d suggest you get on with it…"
line194="I don’t want to be stuck here all day.’"
line195="She’s right, of course. The thing that is about to happen is going to be deeply unpleasant - for both of us. "
line196="I fidget with the Melt config on my wrist display and point the device towards On-Lam. "
line197="The readings… they’re unbelievably high. "
line198="Definitely not just standard memories over there in her head… there’s something more. I can feel it."
line199="A trap for me, no doubt. "
line200="But as she herself has said - no use in putting it off. "
screen50=[line189,line190,line191,line192,line193,line194,line195,line196,line197,line198,line199,line200]

line201="‘Do it!’ I hear her yell as I press down on the execute command on my wrist…"
line202="…there’s a great, familiar whooshing, as my presence torpedoes in towards an abstraction of On-Lam’s mind. "
line203="Some of the other minor drug-pushers I’ve had to Melt during training with had tiny, insignificant minds. "
line204="In the Melt interface the content of their heads were represented by tiny, dirty shacks with almost nothing inside. "
line205="In comparison, On-Lam’s mind in front of me is a colossal palace, full of intricate rooms, stairs and doors, looping in and out of themselves. "
line206="It’s going to be extremely difficult to find what I’m looking for here. "
screen51=[line201,line202,line203,line204,line205,line206]

line207="I focus deeply on the building ahead and sense that behind one of the doors is what I am looking for. "
line208="A memory - or series of memories - that took place over the course of last night.  "
line209="I see a museum on fire."
line210="I see a figure in a gas mask look upon a room filled with unspeakable violence. "
line211="I see a memorial wreath for a young woman, its leaves yellowed and dying."
screen52=[line207,line208,line209,line210,line211]

line212="This seems…right. "
screen53=[line212]

line213="I feel closer and closer to On-Lam as I focus on her and her thoughts. "
line214="The experience is a bleed between our feelings - there’s a fear there, but also… an anticipation? "
line215="Something isn’t right. "
line216="There is no longer a me… or a her. "
line217="There is a… you? "
line218="Yes… you. It’s you, On-Lam."
screen54=[line213,line214,line215,line216,line217,line218]

line219="You. You are running down a street ablaze with riots. You feel a sick thrill at the violence about to unfurl, and underneath it all, a simmering hate towards Chronosia. You want to see them dead. "
screen55=[line219]

line220="You know that Chronosia are after you, and that they will catch you soon… but not until you collect the four Boxes, scattered among the streets of San Weyhoon. It kills you that you will only be able to reach one of them tonight. "
screen56=[line220]

line221="Just one of three. "
line222="The first box lies with Rachel Monet, a deep cover operative posing as a director of the museum of Chronosia Industries."
line223="The second and third boxes were sadly captured by the Chrono-scum - they were being taken by convoy over to a nearby outpost, just past the Radius Bridge."
line224="The fourth box is located in [REDACTED]"
screen57=[line221,line222,line223,line224]

line225="There is a slight chill, and I can feel my mind separate from On-Lam’s a little."
line226="Redacted? How? It’s more of a feeling than a word… When I try to access that section of On-Lam’s memory, it’s like I’m being physically forced out. I will figure this out later - at least I have a grip on where the other boxes are for the time being."
line227="I feel myself merge back into On-Lam’s consciousness…"
screen58=[line225,line226,line227]

line228="This city is still recoiling from the death of Commander Emily Yu, a notoriously cruel Chronosia operative - the Shogunate were blamed on the murder as always… But you know that the Shogunate had nothing to do with it.

line236="You recall recent intel from Shogunate HQ saying that two of the boxes have been captured by the Chronoscum, and were being taken by convoy to an outpost full of those vermin. It’s an outpost near Radius Bridge, right on the border between the slums and the more affluent areas of the city."

line241="You turn a corner and see the bridge ahead of you. The scene that unfolds before you is one of abject carnage - in the center of the bridge is an overturned NX999, one of Chronosia Industries’ flagship tanks, set ablaze by who knows what."
line242="You wonder for a moment what could have caused such damage to the colossal machine.  "
line243="In front of it are several crucifixes, to which people - bodies - are nailed. Some are missing limbs, eyes… You think you notice one of them twitch - just your imagination? Your stomach churns at the thought. "

line245="The wailing, rioting crowd in the square encircling the Chronosia outpost in front of you all have ‘X’s carved into their foreheads… "
line246="You could have guessed from the display of violence, but this confirms it - this little slice of hell is the work of the Exers, a gang that has been wreaking havoc on the streets of San Weyhoon for the past several months."

line249="Then again, it’s possible that some of the convoy have survived the attack - it’s possible that they still have the boxes holed up in the outpost ahead. "
line250="As much as you hate the Chronoscum, the boxes are the priority, and, let’s face it, it wouldn’t be the first time you pretended to be one of them to get what you wanted. "

line298="‘What’s the matter, On-Lam?’, she asks, coughing up blood. ‘Don’t tell me you’re surprised? I thought Shogunate intelligence was better than this.
