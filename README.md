# CHRONOSIA
CHRONOSIA is a cyberpunk text adventure written in Python.

The main goal of this text adventure was to use the skills that I learned over the course of the Programming I / Python OOP modules that I took in college. 
There is also a short text converter program that I used to simplify adding the text to the main game. 

This is the initial draft of the game - I am hoping to continue fixing bugs and typos as time goes on.
